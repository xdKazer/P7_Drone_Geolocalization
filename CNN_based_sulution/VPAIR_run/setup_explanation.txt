Hi,
To run the code you need to get acces to the full VPAIR dataset. After you have downloaded the folder create
a folder like below and add the needed info:

vpair_dataset
    - drone (originally called queries - rename it)
    - tiles (reference_views - rename it)
    - camera_callibration.yaml

Then run make_global_pixel_map.py - it makes a global map using lat lon values
afterwards run downscale_sat_img.py
Run SuperPoint_offline.py - it extracts features for all tiles

Lastly run VPAIR_LG.py
